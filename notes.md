# TENANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## Features Implemented so far

`May 26, 2021`

- Completed the UI setup for the admin pages, the home page, the tenants login & registration page.

- I added a feature that allows the super-admin to register other users and assign different roles to them. The roles currently available are super_admin and sub_admin. and also only the super admin can modify the role of a current admin_user, activate/deactivate their account, and also delete their account.
- The login and logout date and time of every admin can be seen by the super admin.
