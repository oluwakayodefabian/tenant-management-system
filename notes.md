  ![admin-register-page](repo_images%5CAdmin-Register.png)
  ![Manage-adminUsers-page](repo_images%5CAdmin-Users-manage.png)
- I added a feature that allows the super-admin to register other users and assign different roles to them. The roles currently available are super_admin and sub_admin. and also only the super admin can modify the role of a current admin_user, activate/deactivate their account, and also delete their account.

- The login and logout date and time of every admin can be seen by the super admin.
